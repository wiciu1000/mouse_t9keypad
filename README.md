# mouse_t9keypad
An app for typing with your 12 button mouse in an old school way.
I had this idea today, so i built this using Gemini.
Program works by counting F13-F24 keys inputs, so you have to map your buttons 1-12 to these.
It is fully configurable, so you can cycle through different characters.
May come in handy when you're using your PC as a source for your TV, for feeling nostalgic, or when you for any reason don't want to or can't use both hands to operate your computer.
Needs administrator permissions.
Feel free to contribute.
